# GalapagosP5

GalapagosP5 v1.0 is a library of Evolutionary Algorithms for Processing.

### Evolutionary Algorithms

Evolutionary Algorithms form a subfield of Artificial Intelligence
called Evolutionary Computing that is based on Charles Darwin theory
of evolution by Natural Selection.

The idea of the Evolutionary Algorithms is improving a population of possible
solutions for a given problem.
Every possible solution (Sample) have characteristics that make it unique.
Each step, all samples are evaluated and determined the level of fitness
for solve the problem. The best-fitness samples are selected for generate
the next population (offspring) who will inherit part of their 
characteristics.

### Name

The name of the library is taken from the Ecuador's islands where
Darwin studied the endemic species that led him to establish his theory.

This library, at the moment, covers only Genetic Algorithms.
